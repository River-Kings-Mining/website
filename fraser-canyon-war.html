        <p>Nlaka’pamux traditional territory is rich in gold.</P>
        <p>In spring of 1858, there were reports of gold found at Nicomen river near Lytton, BC or known as The Forks back then.</p>
        <p>The gold rush was a huge part of British Columbia’s history with the Nlaka’pamux people. As a result of conflict with gold miners there was what is called the Fraser Canyon War in the summer of 1858. The miners and Nlaka’pamux people waged war until there was a resolution between Chief David Sexpínlhemx (Spintlum) and Capitan Henry Snyder on August 22, 1858.</p>
        <p>To this day the great work of Chief Spintlum is memorialized by a monument near the Lytton Anglican Parish Hall and the new bridge that spans across the Thompson River is named after Chief Spintlum. </p>
